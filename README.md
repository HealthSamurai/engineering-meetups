**Reasons to join**

**— Will it be interesting if I already know the topic well?**<br>
Of course! We’ll be happy if you join the discussion after the talk and share your experience. Your perspective will help reveal the topic more fully for the participants.

**— If I don’t understand the topic of the talk at all, will it still be clear to me?**<br>
Absolutely! Usually, at the beginning of the talk, the speaker introduces the participants to the problem area. Even if something remains unclear to you, you can freely ask the speaker your question — after all, there are no stupid questions.
